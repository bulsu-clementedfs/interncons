echo "✓ Computes average score for each subcategory\n";
echo "✓ Rounds mean scores to nearest integer\n";

echo "  - Match students with internship requirements\n";
echo "  - Generate compatibility scores\n";
echo "  - Rank students for specific positions\n";
echo "  - Provide insights on student strengths/weaknesses\n";
