# Adviser Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of enhanced adviser functionality for managing student applications, including approve/reject actions, undo functionality, and student access management.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Reject Button
- Added alongside the existing approve button
- Sets student status to 'archived' instead of removing roles
- Students with archived status are filtered out from both pending and verified lists

### 2. Undo Functionality
- Popup dialog appears after any action (approve/reject/remove access)
- Allows advisers to undo their last action immediately
- Auto-hides after 5 seconds if not used
- Shows success message when undo is completed

### 3. Remove Student Access
- New functionality to remove access from verified students
- Sets student role to null and status to 'unverified'
- Deletes student record and returns them to pending list
- Available in the verified students section

### 4. Enhanced UI
- Checkboxes for selecting multiple students in both pending and verified sections
- "Select All" functionality for both sections
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Database Changes

### User Status Field
The existing `status` field in the `users` table is used with the following values:
- `unverified`: Default state for new students
- `verified`: Students who have been approved
- `archived`: Students who have been rejected

## API Endpoints

### New Routes
```php
POST /application/remove-access - Remove student access
POST /application/undo - Undo last action
```

### Updated Routes
```php
POST /application/approve - Now sets status to 'verified'
POST /application/reject - Now sets status to 'archived'
```

## Controller Methods

### AdviserController
- `approveStudents()` - Approves students and sets status to 'verified'
- `rejectStudents()` - Rejects students and sets status to 'archived'
- `removeStudentAccess()` - Removes student access and returns to pending
- `undoAction()` - Undoes the last action based on action type

## Frontend Components

### React Components
- Enhanced `Application` component with undo dialog
- Dialog component for undo confirmation
- Success message notifications
- Improved student selection interface

### State Management
- Tracks selected students for both pending and verified lists
- Manages undo dialog state and last action
- Handles loading states for all actions

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- All new functionality is covered by automated tests
- Tests verify correct status updates and database changes
- Tests cover undo functionality for all action types

### Test Files
- `tests/Feature/AdviserTest.php` - Updated with new test cases

## Usage Instructions

### For Advisers

1. **Approving Students**
   - Select students from the pending list
   - Click "Approve Selected" button
   - Confirm undo action if needed

2. **Rejecting Students**
   - Select students from the pending list
   - Click "Reject Selected" button
   - Confirm undo action if needed

3. **Removing Student Access**
   - Select students from the verified list
   - Click "Remove Access" button
   - Confirm undo action if needed

4. **Undoing Actions**
   - After any action, a popup will appear
   - Click "Undo Action" to reverse the last action
   - Or click "Cancel" to dismiss the dialog

## Error Handling

- All actions include proper error handling
- Success/error messages are displayed to users
- Database transactions ensure data consistency
- Validation prevents invalid operations

## Security Considerations

- All routes are protected by authentication and role middleware
- Input validation prevents malicious requests
- Advisers can only manage students in their assigned section
- Role-based access control ensures proper permissions

## Future Enhancements

- Audit logging for all actions
- Email notifications for students
- Bulk operations for large datasets
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
