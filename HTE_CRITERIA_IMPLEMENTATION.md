# HTE Criteria Step Implementation

## ✅ **Complete Implementation**

### **Backend Features:**

1. **Database Structure**
   - Fixed `category_weights` table migration (references Category instead of SubCategory)
   - Fixed `subcategory_weights` table migration (references SubCategory correctly)
   - Added timestamps to both weight tables
   - Updated `CategoryWeight` and `SubcategoryWeight` models with proper relationships

2. **HTE Controller**
   - Created `HTEController.php` with `submit()` method
   - Added `getCategoriesForCriteria()` method for API endpoint
   - Handles weight validation and storage
   - Stores weights in respective tables: `category_weights` and `subcategory_weights`

3. **Model Relationships**
   - Updated `HTE` model with weight relationships
   - Updated `CategoryWeight` and `SubcategoryWeight` models with proper fillable properties
   - All models have proper relationships and constraints

4. **API Endpoint**
   - Added `/hte/categories` route for fetching categories with subcategories and questions
   - Returns JSON data for frontend consumption
   - Protected by authentication middleware

### **Frontend Features:**

1. **Collapsible Categories**
   - Each category (except Basic Information) is displayed as a collapsible container
   - Categories can be expanded/collapsed with chevron icons
   - Weight input field for each category

2. **Subcategory Management**
   - Expanding a category reveals its subcategories
   - Each subcategory is also collapsible
   - Weight input field for each subcategory
   - Questions are listed beneath each subcategory when expanded

3. **Weight Assignment**
   - Category weights must total 100% across all categories
   - Subcategory weights must total 100% within their respective parent category
   - Real-time validation with color-coded feedback:
     - Green: Valid (100%)
     - Red: Exceeds 100%
     - Yellow: Incomplete (<100%)

4. **Form Integration**
   - Updated HTE form validation schema to include weight fields
   - Weight data is properly converted for form submission
   - Integrated with existing form step validation

5. **User Experience**
   - Loading state while fetching categories
   - Clear instructions and validation feedback
   - Responsive design with proper spacing
   - Prevents event bubbling on weight inputs

### **Key Components:**

#### **Backend:**
- `HTEController.php` - Handles form submission and weight storage
- `CategoryWeight.php` - Model for category-level weights
- `SubcategoryWeight.php` - Model for subcategory-level weights
- Database migrations for weight tables
- API endpoint for categories data

#### **Frontend:**
- `criteria.tsx` - Main criteria component with collapsible interface
- Updated `form.tsx` - HTE form with weight validation
- Collapsible UI components for expandable sections
- Real-time weight calculation and validation

### **Database Tables:**

1. **category_weights**
   - `id` (primary key)
   - `hte_id` (foreign key to HTE)
   - `category_id` (foreign key to Category)
   - `weight` (unsigned integer)
   - `timestamps`

2. **subcategory_weights**
   - `id` (primary key)
   - `hte_id` (foreign key to HTE)
   - `subcategory_id` (foreign key to SubCategory)
   - `weight` (unsigned integer)
   - `timestamps`

### **Validation Rules:**

1. **Category Weights**
   - Must total exactly 100% across all categories
   - Individual weights: 0-100%

2. **Subcategory Weights**
   - Must total exactly 100% within each parent category
   - Individual weights: 0-100%

3. **Form Validation**
   - All weight fields are required
   - Weights are validated on both frontend and backend
   - Real-time feedback prevents invalid submissions

### **API Endpoints:**

- `GET /hte/categories` - Returns categories with subcategories and questions
- `POST /hte/submit` - Handles HTE form submission with weights

### **Features Implemented:**

✅ **Collapsible Categories** - Each category is expandable/collapsible
✅ **Subcategory Display** - Subcategories shown when category is expanded
✅ **Question Listing** - Questions displayed under each subcategory
✅ **Weight Assignment** - Input fields for category and subcategory weights
✅ **Real-time Validation** - Live calculation and validation of weight totals
✅ **Visual Feedback** - Color-coded validation status
✅ **Database Storage** - Weights stored in respective tables
✅ **Form Integration** - Seamlessly integrated with existing HTE form
✅ **Authentication** - Protected routes and endpoints
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes

### **Usage:**

1. HTE users navigate to the criteria step in the form
2. Categories are loaded from the database and displayed as collapsible sections
3. Users can expand categories to see subcategories and questions
4. Weight inputs allow assignment of percentages to categories and subcategories
5. Real-time validation ensures totals equal 100%
6. Form submission stores all data including weights in the database

The implementation provides a complete, user-friendly interface for HTE users to assign weights to assessment criteria while maintaining data integrity and providing clear feedback.
