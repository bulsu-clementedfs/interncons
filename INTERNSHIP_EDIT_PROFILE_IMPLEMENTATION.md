# Internship Edit Functionality in HTE Profile Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the internship edit functionality directly from the HTE profile page, allowing HTE users to update internship details including basic information and weight allocation without leaving the profile interface.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Edit Button in HTE Profile
- Added an "Edit" button next to each internship's status badge in the profile
- Button navigates to the edit form with pre-filled data
- Located in `resources/js/pages/hte/profile.tsx`

### 2. Status Toggle Button
- Added a "Deactivate/Activate" button for quick status management
- Includes confirmation dialog for status changes
- Button changes appearance based on current status (destructive for deactivate, default for activate)

### 3. Edit Internship Form
- Created `resources/js/pages/hte/edit-internship.tsx` - the edit page
- Created `resources/js/components/form/hte/edit-internship-form.tsx` - the edit form component
- Form includes all internship fields: position, department, number of interns, duration, start/end dates
- Pre-populates with existing internship data and weight allocations

### 4. Backend Controller Methods
- `showEditInternship($id)` - displays the edit form with existing data
- `updateInternship(Request $request, $id)` - handles form submission and updates
- `toggleInternshipStatus($id)` - allows quick status toggle from profile
- Added helper methods to extract duration and dates from placement description

### 5. Routes Added
```php
// Edit Internship routes
Route::get('hte/edit-internship/{id}', [HTEController::class, 'showEditInternship'])->name('hte.edit-internship');
Route::put('hte/edit-internship/{id}', [HTEController::class, 'updateInternship'])->name('hte.update-internship');

// Toggle Internship Status
Route::patch('hte/internship/{id}/toggle-status', [HTEController::class, 'toggleInternshipStatus'])->name('hte.toggle-internship-status');
```

### 6. Enhanced User Experience
- Quick access to edit functionality from the profile page
- Immediate status toggle with confirmation
- Pre-filled forms for seamless editing
- Consistent UI with existing profile design
- Breadcrumb navigation for easy navigation back to profile

## Technical Details

### Data Extraction
The system automatically extracts internship details from the placement description:
- Duration (e.g., "3 months")
- Start date (e.g., "2024-01-01")
- End date (e.g., "2024-04-01")

### Form Pre-population
- All existing internship data is automatically loaded
- Weight allocations are preserved and can be modified
- Form validation ensures data integrity

### Security Features
- Users can only edit their own internships
- Proper validation of all input fields
- CSRF protection through Laravel's built-in middleware
