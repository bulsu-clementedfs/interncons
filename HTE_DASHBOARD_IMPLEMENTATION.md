# HTE Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a comprehensive dashboard for HTE (Host Training Establishment) users in the internship matching system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dashboard Tab in Sidebar
- Added a new "Dashboard" tab in the sidebar for HTE users
- Dashboard is only visible after users have submitted their HTE form
- Tab appears before the Form and Profile tabs for better UX flow

### 2. Dashboard Route and Controller
- New route: `/hte/dashboard`
- New controller method: `HTEController::dashboard()`
- Redirects users to form if they haven't submitted HTE data yet
- Provides comprehensive dashboard data including:
  - Company statistics
  - Internship information
  - Assessment criteria weights
  - Recent activity

### 3. Modular Dashboard Components
The dashboard is built using modular, reusable components:

#### StatsCard Component
- Displays key metrics with icons
- Supports string, number, and React element values
- Reusable across different dashboard sections

#### CompanyInfoCard Component
- Shows company details and contact information
- Includes company name, address, email, phone, and contact person
- Uses consistent iconography and layout

#### RecentInternshipsCard Component
- Displays latest internship opportunities
- Shows position title, department, and slot count
- Handles empty state gracefully

#### CategoryWeightsCard Component
- Visualizes assessment criteria weight distribution
- Shows progress bars for each category
- Only renders when weights data is available

#### QuickActionsCard Component
- Provides shortcuts to common tasks
- Configurable actions with custom icons and colors
- Default actions include: View Profile, Manage Internships, View Reports

### 4. Dashboard Data Structure
The dashboard provides the following data:

```php
return Inertia::render('hte/dashboard', [
    'hte' => $dashboardData,
    'stats' => [
        'totalInternships' => $totalInternships,
        'activeInternships' => $activeInternships,
        'totalSlots' => $totalSlots,
        'companyName' => $dashboardData->company_name,
        'contactPerson' => $dashboardData->cperson_fname . ' ' . $dashboardData->cperson_lname,
        'email' => $dashboardData->company_email,
        'phone' => $dashboardData->cperson_contactnum,
        'address' => $dashboardData->company_address,
    ],
    'recentInternships' => $recentInternships,
    'categoryWeights' => $categoryWeights,
]);
```

### 5. User Flow Improvements
- After form submission, users are redirected to the dashboard
- Success message includes a "Go to Dashboard" button
- Dashboard provides immediate overview of submitted information

## Code Structure

### Directory Structure
```
